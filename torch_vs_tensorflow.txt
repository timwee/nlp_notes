-----------
- a bit confusing with multiple packages (nn, optim, nngraph)
- seems to have a lot of options for copying and not copying memory
- concept of "views" into storage
- seems to give a lot of flexibility

Tensorflow
-------------
- wire up the graph explicitly (though there are helper libraries like keras and tf-slim)
