- can use Keras with tensorflow as backend
	how stable is this?
- "inference requires less precision than training generally", so can use smaller floats?
	they use 8-bits.
- tensor processing unit - specialized hardware
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00981 revisiting synchronous vs async
	found that sync is actually faster overall, < noise

PRIMITIVES
------------------

Operations vs kernels
----------------
Operations are abstract operators. Kernels are concrete implementations.

- send and receive are nodes in the graph


Graph
----------------
- graph is built implicitly
- automated differentiation just adds nodes to the graph (similar to theano)
- serialized into graph.proto
- sent via grpc


Sessions and Distributing Computation
---------------
- a few processes in distributed setting
	1. Client process
	2. Master process
	3. worker processes




Distributed Placing
--------------
- A variable can be pinned to a particular device https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/variables/index.html#device-placement
- There's a placement algorithm


Tools
-----------------
1. TensorBoard

Model structures that optimize for parallel computation
-----------------
- multiple "towers" that are independent (AlexNet - 2 towers)
- local reuse (conv nets)
- parts of models are only activated for some data/examples

Deep LSTM
-----------------
he has example code in slides


tensorflow queues
--------------------
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/threading_and_queues/index.html
- uses:
	1. input prefetching
	2. grouping similar examples
	3. randomization and shuffling


network optimization
--------------------------
- they cut off to 16 bits while transferring over network.
- they don't convert to iEEE 16 bit, they preserve exponent bits and cut off mantissa.

Quantization for inference
---------------------------
- quantize weights to 8 bits. (4 8 bit operations per cycle on mobile)
- Harder to do for training bec. the range for weights that you want will vary through the training process

Google applications
#######################

Google Photos Search
--------------
cluster and search based on content of images


Same model repurposed for different purposes
#######################
Street View
----------------
- text detection "in the wild"
- google project sunroof


RankBrain
---------------
- 3rd most important search ranking signal
- traditionally search ranking team want very explainable models



Robotics
----------------
They don't use ROS, but tensorflow generates motor commands for the robotic software.
They also do this for simulated robots.
